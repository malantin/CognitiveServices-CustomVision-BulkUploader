# Cognitive Services Custom Vision Bulk Uploader
A small console application to bulk upload images to the Cognitive Services Custom Vision API. Just open the solution in Visual Studio, add your Custom Vision Subscription Key, a name for your project and add some tags. Now you can set folders to upload and tag images. After uploading the images the model will be trained. 

This project is based on the official sample on https://github.com/Microsoft/Cognitive-CustomVision-Windows.
